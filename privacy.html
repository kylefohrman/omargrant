        <h3><u>Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies</u></h3><br>
        We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Websites to help us provide better
        customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure
        visitor activity on iPolish, Inc. websites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable.
        This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." iPolish, Inc., iPolish, Inc.’s customers or

        marketing as well as to help us provide better customer service.<br>
        <br>
        Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that
        transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as
        clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand
        trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your
        transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.<br>
        <br>
        We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies,
        including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which
        may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some
        iPolish, Inc. pages may use cookies, sent by iPolish, Inc. or its third party vendors, or other technologies
        to better serve you when you return to the Web site. You can set your browser to notify you before you
        receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to
        turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly.<br>
        <br>
        This iPolish, Inc. website also may use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to
        provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across iPolish,
        Inc.'s websites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated
        which may be processed by us or by our suppliers. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with
        cookies. If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can
        set your browser to turn off cookies.<br>
        <br>
        Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use cookies on our site. We have no access to or
        control over these cookies.<br>
        <br>
        If you turn off cookies, Web beacons and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the
        notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are
        disregarded.<br>
